Connect the Circuit Boards

This is my first memory match game featuring a tech theme. While it is still in development, the intended purpose is to match ten cards. Once all ten cards are matched, the player wins and the game is restarted. Once a player finds two matches, a notification will appear and a when the player wins the game, a notification will appear. The game will automotamically restart when all ten matches are found.
